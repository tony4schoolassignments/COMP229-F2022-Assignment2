                The bug hops randomly around the game area at a given interval. The player tries to catch the bug by clicking on it. If he succeeds, the score is incremented and the hopping interval is decremented  by a number of milliseconds, so it gets harder to catch the bug.
                If the game becomes too challenging, the payer can reset the speed to the initial hopping interval by clicking the Reset Speed button.
                If the player wants, he can start again by resetting the score by clicking the Reset Score button.
